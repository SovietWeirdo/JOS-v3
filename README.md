# JOS-v3
(V 1 and 2 didn't boot up after the first day of use.)
Fairly simple to use. It was created in python and is based off of cmd prompt.
Do not to boot onto a cpu, this is made for use inside of Windows and may work in Mac in Linux, Idk I haven't tryed it. (I'm a Windows user.)
I credit Cyber-Coding for the basic frame.
Create a shortcut for the file "Bootup.py"
That's all!
(I'm assuming you know how to unzip a file.)
